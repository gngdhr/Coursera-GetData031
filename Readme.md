# Coursera-031: Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This code repository holds the run_analysis.R, codebook and README for the final project related to the Getting & Cleaning data course on Coursera (GetData-031)

##How the run_analysis.R script works
The run_analysis script is a self contained file that can be opened with R studio and run from the current working directory.This script assumes that the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory is in the same directory as the file is.

##Summary of using run_analysis.R
1. Download the script
2. Load the file in R or RStudio. 
3. Ensure that a directory named "UCI HAR Dataset" with the files for the project is available in the same folder
4. Run the script
4. The code produces an aggregate.data.all table as the final outcome
5. The code also creates a file named gngdhr-getdata-031.txt in the same directory
